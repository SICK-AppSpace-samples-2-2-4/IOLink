## IOLink
Connecting and communicating to IO-Link device
### Description
This sample shows how to connect to an IO-Link device and write data.
### How to Run
This sample can be run on any AppSpace device which can act as an IO-Link master,
e.g. SIM family. The IO-Link device must be properly connected to a port which
supports IO-Link. If the port is configured as IO-Link master, see script, the
power LED blinks slowly. When a IO-Link device is successfully connected the
LED blinks rapidly.
### More Information
See device manual of IO-Link master for according ports. See manual of IO-Link
device for further IO-Link specific description and device specific commands
